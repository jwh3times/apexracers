# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Playwright E2E test harness (`web/e2e/`) with a register→dashboard smoke test; run locally with `npm run test:e2e` (requires the full stack at `http://localhost:8080`).
- Non-blocking per-PR Playwright E2E CI workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): spins up a Postgres service, builds the SPA into the API wwwroot, runs the suite, and uploads the Playwright report as an artifact; not yet a required status check.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-16

Initial release — the version currently deployed to production
(<https://apexracers.gg>).

### Added

#### Platform

- Lap time percentile tracking and car recommendations for iRacing weekly series.
- ASP.NET Core Web API with use-case-oriented controllers backed by focused
  service classes.
- PostgreSQL persistence via EF Core, with the full iRacing catalog modeled
  (series, seasons, weeks, tracks, cars, car classes, subsessions, and results).

#### Authentication & accounts

- User registration and login issuing JWT access tokens and rotating refresh
  tokens.
- Refresh token rotation, logout/revocation, profile updates, and theme
  preference persistence.
- iRacing OAuth 2.0 callback handling.
- Role-based access control with an `AdminOnly` policy.

#### Features

- **Series** — browse active weekly series.
- **Week detail** — cars and aggregate lap stats for a series week.
- **Percentile** — a driver's lap time percentile for a specific car and week,
  computed and cached.
- **Recommendations** — ranked car recommendations for the authenticated user.
- **Analytics** — per-car percentile history and stats.
- **Telemetry** — iRacing `.ibt` file upload with lap extraction, plus personal
  best laps per track and car.
- **Admin** — user role management and feature flag CRUD.
- **Feature flags** — per-user flag evaluation based on role.

#### Data ingestion & seeding

- Standalone ingestion background worker that pulls data from the iRacing API
  via `Aydsko.iRacingData`.
- Idempotent CLI seeder that loads catalog data and generates synthetic lap time
  data across all series for a usable UI without live data.

#### Frontend

- Vite + React + TypeScript single-page app with a typed API client.
- Public marketing landing page, login, terms, and privacy pages.
- Authenticated app shell (sidebar + top nav + footer) with dashboard, series,
  week detail, percentile, analytics, recommendations, my laps, telemetry,
  profile, settings, and admin pages.
- Fluid design system that scales with viewport width, plus light/dark/auto
  theming.

#### Infrastructure & tooling

- Docker Compose stack (PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, API) for local development.
- Azure deployment: API on App Service, ingestion worker as a Container App,
  with Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, and PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with enforced 80% test coverage gates (line and branch
  for the backend; statements, branches, functions, and lines for the frontend),
  Prettier formatting checks, and Dependabot dependency updates.

#### Project documentation

- README, contribution guidelines, code of conduct, support guide, and security
  policy.
